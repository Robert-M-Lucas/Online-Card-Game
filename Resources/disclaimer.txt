This game is in unfinished state and very buggy, if you encounter a persistent bug, try restarting your computer.

You can't try to host a game twice without restarting the game.

To host a game you need to open port 8108 and give your IP to anyone playing with you (this can be found in the lobby). 
DO NOT GIVE YOUR IP TO ANYONE YOU DON'T TRUST. 
DO NOT JOIN A GAME WITH A PERSON YOU DON'T TRUST. 
Any damages from or to a person you host for, join or play with are your responsibility.

This game works on a complete trust system. The server will believe anything a client tells it. Be wary of cheaters.
